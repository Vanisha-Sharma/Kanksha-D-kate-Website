        "I lived with multiple phobias, depression and severe fear and anxiety for the last 28 years. I had a constant fear of death of my near ones. It was a severe condition. I was very very sensitive towards every negative thing and feared as if it is going to happen. I did not feel any meaning in life. Each day felt like a month. I underwent lot of examination also but all my medical reports were normal. I visited lot of therapists, psychiatrists but the medication started giving me reactions.",
        "When I joined Kanksha, I was surprised. As we started the procedures all my phobias dissolved so fast within just 2 sessions. I do not even remember what concerns I had before the procedures. Now I feel really amazing. I am now free from all that was weighing me down. I just feel much lighter each day and so blissful from the inside. It makes me happy, fulfilled and especially very very grateful.. I feel stronger emotionally, physically and psychologically. My skin looks younger and radiant now and naturally glows from inside without any makeup/cosmetics. I had no idea that concerns which existed for such a long time can be cured so fast and easily. It’s a miracle life for me.",

        "Majority of my work involves meeting people, interacting with other businesses, closing deals, while overseeing different functions of the business. I was doing good until after a point I started feeling burnt out and saturated in life. I had no clarity and it took a toll on my emotional wellbeing affecting my relationships and health. I registered with Kanksha D’Kate to enhance myself in all life domains. I wanted a better balance in general. I was also looking forward to improving my effective team management skills and being able to build credibility with potential stakeholders in the first go.",
        "The most surprising breakthrough is that my long standing breathing issue is no longer there. Ever since the pandemic, I started to have breathing issues even after my COVID recovery and it was severe in a way that I started to plan my life around it- avoided basic physical activities, avoiding places with different climates other than that of my city’s, avoided family gatherings. Now I am free of all those concerns and the shift feels really liberating as I involve myself in sports whenever I can, and enjoy travelling to places with my family.",
        "During my first consultation call with Kanksha, we discussed certain challenges except the breathing issue. I forgot to mention it because I had accepted this way of life internally. It did not come to my mind to discuss it. As soon as Kanksha discovered it, in a mere 1 hr session my breathing issue was gone. Extremely surprising and ever since that session, I have not had any medications from the past 6 months which I was taking for the last 2.5-3 years. That’s something to admire about Kanksha ,she identified the limitations in a way that I won’t identify for myself. I have dropped 3 sizes as I no longer have a habit of binge eating.",
        "Now I have better clarity in my decisions, increased enthusiasm and energy to work.",
        "I see people approaching me with great opportunities. It’s a superb shift. Never seen or experienced anything like this before. I have a more balanced personality now.",
        "My leadership is getting responded to, I no longer have to go around pushing my teams to deliver, infact they are simply functioning in sync. It is like things are happening on their own effortlessly. Like Kanksha says - FLo through life and that’s actually what is happening and everything is growing like I wanted.",
        "I recently closed a high-stake deal of 6 crores which would not have been possible without my new abilities. I observed a change in my approach and negotiation during that meeting. It was spectacular as I was able to see avenues that were not visible to me before. My relationship is in a great space today.",
        "The need for balance has gone and everything feels effortless.",
        "Kanksha is phenomenal. I have no words for her. She has this rare clarity. She gets in, does the work and leaves you permanently evolved. No unnecessary fluff or hype. The shifts continue to multiply with time for me. I have got some of the breakthroughs immediately, some shifts happened days after and some months after. I didn’t know change could be this easy. ",

        "The ¡FLo! Immersion experience opened dimensions I never knew existed within me. I discovered my true potential and learned to harness the infinite energy that was always there. Working with Kanksha has been life-changing. Before starting this journey, I was running a successful tech startup, but I felt like I was constantly fighting against invisible barriers. Every decision felt heavy, every challenge drained my energy, and despite external success, I felt disconnected from my own power. Kanksha's approach through ¡FLo! was unlike anything I had experienced before. The precision with which she identified the root patterns that were limiting me was extraordinary. Through the installation cycles, I began to notice shifts that were life-changing. My decision-making became effortless, my energy levels increased, and most importantly, I started operating from a place of authentic confidence rather than compensatory drive. The transformation rippled through every aspect of my life. My relationships deepened, my health improved, and I found myself accessing levels of creativity and strategic thinking I didn't know I possessed. What amazes me most is how natural and sustainable these changes feel. It's like Kanksha helped me remember who I actually am beneath all the conditioning and limitations I had unconsciously accepted. The investment in ¡FLo! Immersion has been the most valuable decision I've made for my personal and professional evolution.",

I now have sensible confidence like never before. I cracked selection processes of top B-schools of the country, won national-level competitions, anxiety has stopped and even resolved conflicts in my family within a few minutes, that too all without stress and any fear or hesitation I once carried.

Firstly I am amazed after experiencing this science. It is not something you find usually on the internet, totally different. Thanks to this, I have started to attract clients who find value in what I do, are really aligned with my work and I am constantly in a productive state of mind. I think and feel motivated all the time. It feels like I am achieving what I wanted for a long time.I have earned 40Lacs of profit over and above my usual profit. My business has grown by 40% without extra efforts which I earlier thought would take atleast 6-7 years to achieve but nowadays I not only have plans, it is also easily flowing in execution. As a side effect, I am also seeing a drastic improvement in my entire mindset for other situations in my life. I am able to connect with people with more warmth. I do not fear social interactions and that translates to me building meaningful connections with people I meet. I have had an overwhelming experience for good. I feel lighter as my entire system feels more in sync with my life. My body clock has changed totally. I wake up early, I am able to do more tasks with discipline, and I am full of energy all day.

        "I came seeking change but found complete transformation. Kanksha's approach to breakthrough work is unlike anything I've experienced. My life has become a beautiful flow of possibilities. The precision and care in her methodology is extraordinary. As a creative director, I thought I understood the power of vision and imagination, but I was functioning from a limited perspective. I had been struggling with creative blocks, imposter syndrome, and a constant feeling that I wasn't living up to my potential. Traditional coaching and therapy had helped to some degree, but the changes were always temporary. When I discovered Kanksha, I was initially skeptical about the claims of permanent transformation. However, from our very first session, I could sense that this was different. Kanksha has an uncanny ability to see patterns and connections that aren't obvious on the surface. She worked with me at a level that felt almost architectural, like she was redesigning the very foundation of how I process information and make decisions. The installation process was gentle and powerful. I didn't have to relive trauma or force myself through painful exercises. Instead, it felt like layers of limitation were simply dissolving, revealing capacities that had always been there. My creative output has not only increased dramatically, but the quality and originality of my work has reached new heights. Clients have noticed the difference, and I've been offered opportunities that seemed impossible before. Beyond the professional gains, I feel a deep sense of peace and alignment that permeates everything I do.",

The process exceeded my expectations in every way. Kanksha's ability to identify and work with the unconscious patterns that were driving my behavior was remarkable. Through the installation cycles, I experienced shifts that felt both immediate and deeply rooted. My relationship with stress completely transformed, instead of being overwhelmed by challenges, I found myself naturally accessing resourceful states that allowed me to navigate complexity with ease and even enjoyment. My business performance improved dramatically, not because I was working harder, but because I am executing from a fundamentally different internal state. Decision-making became intuitive, opportunities seemed to appear effortlessly, and my team responded to my leadership in ways that surprised everyone.
